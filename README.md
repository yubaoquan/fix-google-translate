# fix-google-translate
Fix the position bug of google translate extension.

Just override the `position` property of class `jfk-bubble`, so the position will change from `absolute` to `fixed`, and you will see the translate bubble again.

Also fix the position of `pop-up icon`, which is for user to click to call the popup panel.
